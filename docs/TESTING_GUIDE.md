# Testing Guide

This document provides guidance on understanding and updating the automated tests for the `homebrew-migration-helper` script, specifically focusing on the mock environment used in `tests/basic.bats`.

## Running Tests

Tests are run using `bats-core`. Ensure it's installed (`brew install bats-core`) and then run the tests from the project root directory:

```bash
bats tests
```

## Mock Environment (`tests/basic.bats`)

To test the script's logic in isolation without relying on external dependencies (`brew`, `curl`, `defaults`, `jq`), network access, or the state of locally installed applications, the `tests/basic.bats` file utilizes a mock environment created within its `setup()` function and torn down in `teardown()`.

### Structure

The `setup()` function creates a temporary directory structure within `BATS_TMPDIR` for each test run. Key components include:

*   **`$MOCK_BIN_DIR`**: Contains mock shell scripts that mimic the behavior of required external commands (`brew`, `defaults`, `jq`, `curl`). This directory is temporarily added to the `PATH` during the test run. Note that the mock `jq` is explicitly invoked via the `HMH_MOCK_JQ_PATH` environment variable (set in `setup()`) to ensure it overrides the system `jq`.
*   **`$MOCK_DATA_DIR`**: Stores mock data files used by the mock commands.
    *   `mock_api_cache.json`: Simulates the JSON data downloaded from the Homebrew Cask API.
    *   `mock_brew_info.json`: Simulates the JSON output of `brew info --json=v2 --installed`.
*   **`$FAKE_APPS_DIR`**: Contains fake `.app` directory structures, including minimal `Contents/Info.plist` files, to simulate manually installed applications found during the scan.
*   **`$MOCK_CACHE_DIR`**: Used as the target cache directory (`-c`) when running the script within tests, ensuring the mock `curl` writes the mock API data to the correct temporary location.

### Updating Tests

If you modify the main script (`scripts/find-missing-casks.sh`) in a way that changes:

1.  **How external commands are called:** You may need to update the corresponding mock script in `$MOCK_BIN_DIR` within the `setup()` function to handle the new arguments or behavior.
2.  **The data expected from external commands:** Update the relevant JSON files in `$MOCK_DATA_DIR` within the `setup()` function (e.g., add new casks to `mock_api_cache.json` or change version numbers).
3.  **The expected output format:** Update the assertions (`[[ "$output" == *...* ]]` or `echo "$output" | grep ...`) within the relevant `@test` function(s).
4.  **Logic related to application structure:** You might need to add or modify the fake app structures created in `$FAKE_APPS_DIR` within the `setup()` function.

**Example:** If you add logic to read a new key from `Info.plist`, you would need to:
    *   Update the mock `defaults` script in `setup()` to handle reading that new key.
    *   Potentially add the new key/value to the fake `Info.plist` files created for the fake apps.
    *   Add assertions in a test case to verify the new logic works as expected based on the mock setup.

Remember to keep the mocks and test data consistent with the logic you are testing.
**Note on `jq` Mock:** The mock `jq` script currently forces the `empty` filter (used for JSON validation) to always succeed (`exit 0`). This was implemented as a workaround for CI environment inconsistencies where file checks within the mock were unreliable. While this ensures tests pass in CI, be aware that it bypasses actual JSON validation in the test environment.
